      <description>Hi!
I am a software engineer - since I was 9 üòÑ.
What can I say about myself? I always want to reach deeper understanding of the stuff I am dealing with. How exactly is rebalancing in Kafka implemented? How does Zookeeper reach its consensus? Those are the questions that inspire me to dig in the code and share my findings with others.
In my opinion the most important virtue of a software engineer is eagerness to understand the principles that drive almost all technologies, since libraries, frameworks, and databases come and go, but principles last forever.</description>
