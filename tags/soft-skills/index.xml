      <description>My wife was utterly stunned and speechless when she found me at 3 AM, engaged in an activity she least expected. There I was, supposed to be sound asleep since I had an early start for work the next day, but instead, I was up to something quite the opposite. Little did I know that the simple sound of a camera shutter would give me away so easily!
It was this very sound that roused my wife from her sleep.</description>

      <description>Did you know that &amp;hellip; ü§î

      <description>Hi! Hello! Welcome to my first post on soft skills! If this is not the first time you&amp;rsquo;re on my blog, you know that as a software engineer, I&amp;rsquo;ve been mainly writing about technical topics, but I strongly believe that soft skills are just as important for success in any field as technical ones. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my thoughts on a book I recently read - Atomic Habits written by James Clear - and discuss how I&amp;rsquo;ve applied some of its ideas in my daily work, encouraging you to read and use such books as well!</description>
